## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of Freenet plugins organized as Git submodules. Each plugin in the `projects/` directory is a separate Freenet plugin that extends the functionality of the Freenet peer-to-peer network. All plugins are related to the Hyphanet (formerly Freenet) project and focus on providing decentralized, anonymous, and censorship-resistant communication tools.
